## Image Face Clustering with Machine Learning

This project implements **unsupervised machine learning** techniques for **face clustering** using a dataset of facial images. It involves **image preprocessing, feature extraction, and clustering** with **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** to group similar faces based on facial embeddings. The goal is to identify patterns in facial data using **face recognition algorithms** and **clustering models**.
&nbsp; 
### Key Objectives
- **Face Detection & Preprocessing**: Detect and crop faces from images, extracting features using the `face_recognition` library.
- **Feature Extraction**: Convert facial images into numerical embeddings for clustering.
- **Clustering Optimization**: Determine the best number of clusters using **Inertia** and **Silhouette Score**.
- **Clustering Models**: Apply **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** to group similar faces.
- **Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization**: Use **t-SNE** to visualize clustered results.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compare clustering performance to assess the best segmentation approach.

## Image Face Clustering with Machine Learning

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** for **face clustering** using a dataset of facial images. It involves **image preprocessing, feature extraction, and clustering** with **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** to group similar faces based on facial embeddings.  
The goal is to identify patterns in facial data using **face recognition algorithms** and **clustering models**.

### Key Objectives
- **Preprocessing**: Detect and crop faces from images, extracting features using `face_recognition` library.
- **Feature Extraction**: Convert facial images into numerical embeddings for clustering.
- **Optimal Clustering Selection**: Determine the best number of clusters using **Inertia** and **Silhouette Score**.
- **Clustering Models**: Apply **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** for grouping faces.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use **t-SNE** for visualization of clustered results.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compare clustering performance to assess the best segmentation approach.
